/**
 * <p></p>
 * Decorator design patterns come under the structural pattern category that allows you to add new features to existing objects without altering the structure. This pattern creates a decorator class that works as a wrapper to the existing class by retaining the class methodsâ€™ signatures intact.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This pattern uses abstract classes as well as interfaces with composition to implement the wrapper. Mostly, they are used to apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as the functionalities are divided into classes with distinct concerns. In terms of structure, this pattern is similar to the chain of responsibility pattern.
